This project features an automatic image colorization model utilizing a U-Net architecture combined with perceptual loss for enhanced colorization quality. The U-Net, a powerful convolutional neural network, captures intricate image features through its encoder-decoder structure. Perceptual loss, leveraging a pre-trained VGG network, ensures the model generates visually pleasing and realistic colors by comparing high-level features between the generated and true color images. This approach balances pixel-level accuracy and perceptual realism, leading to superior colorization results. The project includes training scripts  and sample results, providing a comprehensive framework for automatic image colorization.
